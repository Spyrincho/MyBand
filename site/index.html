        <h2>Early Life 1991-2007</h2>
        <h3>
          Hayley Kiyoko Alcroft was born on April 3, 1991, in Los Angeles, California, to figure skater/choreographer Sarah Kawahara and actor/comedian Jamie Alcroft. Her mother is from Canada and is of Japanese ancestry and her father is from Ohio and has English, Welsh, Irish and German ancestry.<br>
           Kiyoko has two siblings, Alysse and Thatcher. She began acting at a young age, appearing in national commercials for companies such as GM Onstar, Slim Jim, and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Insisting on drum lessons at age 6, she was writing drum charts for new releases and selling them in a local music store by age 11.<br>
            At 8 years old, Kiyoko wrote a song called "Notice", which her father still urges her to release. She was elected President of her middle school and high school freshman classes and Vice-president in her senior year. She was appointed Commissioner of Entertainment in her sophomore year and Commissioner of Pep Rallies in her junior year.<br>
            She created and choreographed "The Agoura High Step Team" which was faculty-approved as a school club under her direction. The team placed 3rd at a Nationals competition in 2005.[9] Upon graduation in 2009, she was accepted into Clive Davis School of Recorded Music at New York University but initially deferred until eventually declining due to career opportunities.
            Kiyoko was discovered at the age of 5 when she went with her friend to a photo shoot. The director asked her to step in front of the camera, and she ended up in a national print ad for KnowledgeWare. Nickelodeon spotted her at the Culver City Ice Rink, and she ended up featured in and narrating a short piece about children in sports called, "I'm Hayley, a Skater".<br>
            Kiyoko continued to hone her skills in middle school plays and in 7th grade she, after seeing Eurasian girls like herself act in J. C. Penney commercials, asked for an agent. She got her commercial agent and booked her first audition, claiming acting was always just something she did on the side to make money for college and music equipment.<br>
             Kiyoko started the garage band Hede, named after her grandfather, in November 2007 and released five songs on Myspace and a music video for "Warehouse". The band performed locally on several occasions and split in 2009 after the remaining band members left for college. Her grandfather died in 2011. He was one of the biggest inspirations in Kiyoko's life.

        <h2>Sexuality & Musical Influence</h2>
        <img src="../images/pride.jpg" style="max-height:200px; max-width:350px; float:left; padding:15px;" alt="LGBT Pride Flag">
        <h3>
          Kiyoko is a lesbian and she is dubbed "Lesbian Jesus" by her fans. She knew she was attracted to girls when she was six years old, coming out to her parents in the sixth grade. She had a crush on a female swim teacher, and upon realizing she liked girls, she grew up struggling with those feelings, fearing rejection and judgment if she came out.<Br>
            Kiyoko wanted to inspire confidence in young people dealing with the same struggles. Kiyoko's music is focused on her story and emotions she's experienced while coming to terms with her identity. The "This Side of Paradise" music video focused on her struggles with expressing her true self and the "Gravel to Tempo" music video draws on her experiences with having crushes on girls while growing up. In a 2016 interview, she expressed her frustration about not connecting to people the way she wanted. When Lily May-Young, one of the co-writers for Girls Like Girls, asked Kiyoko about something about herself that no one knew and she was afraid to sing about, Kiyoko wanted to sing about the fact that she likes girls, but was struggling to be out about that Tegan and Sara and Katy Perry's "I Kissed a Girl" were Kiyoko's turning point and inspiration to turn to pop music. Through her music, Kiyoko works to normalize lesbian relationships in a society and music industry that she sees as being very heteronormative.
            "If you see two girls falling in love and normalizing that, then [people] can go, 'I can fall in love, too. I can be that person. I can look like that. I can get a girl that looks like that.' If they see that, then they can believe it. It's just how we are."
            After seeing the impact her music has on her fans, Kiyoko regretted not being open about her sexuality sooner.
            Her song, "Mercy/Gatekeeper" talks about the depression she dealt with after suffering from her concussion.
